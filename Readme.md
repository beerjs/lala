##BeerJS/lala

This is the official Greater Lafayette beerjs group! 
This group is for anyone interested in learning about Javascript - be that Node, React, johnnyfive, or any other awesome Javascript topic. 
We will be hosting many different kinds of talks for all skill levels. 

**Our current meetups are BYOB, but we are looking for sponsors. In addition, if you or your company has an awesome office you want to show off, we would love to host a meet up there!**

Lala BeerJS meetings are going to loosely follow the following simple format, but may be multiplied by Math.random().
- 15 minutes of hanging out, meeting new people, drinking beer, etc
- 5 minute introduction to the BeerJS for new members
- 10 minutes of discussion about the next meetings/cool stuff going on/other important notes
- 30 minute talk
- 30 minutes of hanging out and beer, talking about the talk, whatever people want to talk about

Note: beer.js is about creating social spaces to strengthen software communities. There is no requirement to drink to participate.
