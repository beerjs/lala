##BeerJS/lala

This is the official Greater Lafayette beerjs group! 
This group is for anyone interested in learning about Javascript - be that Node, React, johnnyfive, or any other awesome Javascript topic. 
We will be hosting many different kinds of talks for all skill levels. 

**Our meetups are a part of [HackLafayette](http://www.meetup.com/hacklafayette/), but we are always looking for sponsors. If you would like to buy pizza or beer or host a BeerJS in your office, please get in touch!**

Because of our current hosting situation (at the awesome [Matchbox](http://matchboxstudio.com)), we have to split up the beer and the Javascript. As such we meet, talk, and then head to a bar for an "afterparty".

Lala BeerJS meetings are going to loosely follow the following simple format, but may be multiplied by Math.random().
- 15 minutes of hanging out, meeting new people, etc
- 5 minute introduction to the BeerJS for new members
- 10 minutes of discussion about the next meetings/cool stuff going on/other important notes
- 30 minute talk
- 30 minutes of hanging out and potentially heading out to a nearby bar to grab a beer, talking about the talk, whatever people want to talk about

*Note: beer.js is about creating social spaces to strengthen software communities. There is no requirement to drink to participate.*
