##BeerJS/lala

This is the official Greater Lafayette beerjs group! 
This group is for anyone interested in learning about Javascript - be that Node, React, johnnyfive, or any other awesome Javascript topic. 
We will be hosting many different kinds of talks for all skill levels. 

**Our current meetups are BYOB, but we are looking for sponsors. In addition, if you or your company has an awesome office you want to show off, we would love to host a meet up there!**

Note: beer.js is about creating social spaces to strengthen software communities. There is no requirement to drink to participate.
